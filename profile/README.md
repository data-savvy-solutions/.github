### [ingest-python](https://github.com/data-savvy-solutions/ingest-small)

`ingest-python` is an ingestion tool written in Python (relying only on locally installable packages such as Pandas) designed to extract data from source systems and persist it into SQL Server. It is intended for small datasets, where "small" refers to data volumes that do not require big data frameworks.

The tool supports datasets larger than available memory using Pandas chunking. It covers the Extract and Load stages of an ELT pipeline.

For more details, see the [ingest-python README](https://github.com/data-savvy-solutions/ingest-python/blob/main/README.md).
